## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- New manual action to import legacy global layouts into the current scene when migrating older worlds.

### Changed
- Camera configuration is now strictly scene-scoped. New scenes start empty and no longer inherit saved global layouts automatically.
- Camera configuration UI now requires an active scene before editing layouts, effects, overlays, name styles, or scene presets.
- Legacy `playerLayouts` remain available for manual migration, but they are no longer applied automatically at runtime.
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:

  - download URL points to tag archive `v2.0.0`

### Fixed
- Scene lifecycle cleanup now prunes orphaned scene profile data and clears deleted-scene drafts.
- The public configuration contract no longer exposes unused geometry skew fields.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- New name plate style controls in `Name Config` for font size, line height, edge offset, padding, custom background, and custom border styling.

### Fixed
- Transparent custom name plate backgrounds no longer leave a residual default edge line behind.
- Saving `Overlay Config` no longer wipes camera geometry in `module` mode, preventing cameras from jumping back to `0,0`.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.7.0`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.7.0`

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- New `Transparent Native Frame` option in `Effects Config` for cameras controlled in `module` mode.

### Fixed
- Saving `Effects Config` no longer wipes existing camera geometry when the transparent-frame option is toggled.
- Transparent-frame mode now clears residual native camera chrome layers instead of leaving the Foundry shell visible behind custom overlays.
- Transparent-frame mode now mirrors `clip-path` onto the visual camera layers so non-rectangular camera shapes do not keep a rectangular background box.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.6.0`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.6.0`

## [1.5.10] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Shared camera layout updates now reapply across connected clients when the GM changes world-scoped scene profiles or player layouts.
- Responsive scene preset geometry now preserves explicit `vw` and `vh` values instead of collapsing affected cameras back to `0,0`.
- Camera layouts now reapply immediately after Foundry rerenders camera views, reducing visible flicker after WebRTC rerenders and popout transitions.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.10`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.10`

## [1.5.9] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Saving from `Layout`, `Effects`, `Overlay`, `Name`, and `Scene Presets` subwindows no longer reopens `Camera Layout Config` when the hub was already closed.
- Those subwindows now close cleanly after a successful save while still refreshing the main hub when it is already open.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.9`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.9`

## [1.5.8] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Resetting the current player now preserves the active scene camera control mode instead of accidentally dropping back to a fresh native/no-profile state.
- Camera geometry fallback now uses Foundry's default `320x240` camera size instead of allowing oversized reset states.
- Switching a camera back from module-owned geometry to native geometry now restores the previous Foundry-managed size and position more reliably.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.8`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.8`

## [1.5.7] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Scene presets now expose an explicit aspect-ratio selector with `4:3`, `16:9`, `1:1`, and `Match Feed` options.

### Fixed
- Scene preset fallback sizing without live video now defaults to a `4:3` camera box instead of a square box.

### Changed
- `4:3` is now the default aspect ratio for scene presets so generated camera grids better match Foundry's default camera proportions.
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.7`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.7`

## [1.5.6] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- New in-app support report window in `Camera Layout Config` with buttons to refresh the report, copy it to the clipboard, and open the GitHub issue tracker.

### Changed
- Support documentation and the GitHub bug template now point users to the in-app support report flow instead of relying on a hidden macro as the primary path.
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.6`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.6`

## [1.5.5] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Scene presets now support disconnected users in the participant list, keeping active users preselected by default while allowing layouts to be prepared before a session starts.
- New support diagnostics API and helper macro:
  - `dumpModuleDebugReport(userId)`
  - `docs/macros/dump_module_debug_report.js`
- New GitHub bug-report template that asks for Foundry version, browser/OS, console output, and a Charlemos debug report.

### Changed
- Preset UI copy now reflects that all users can be selected, not only active ones.
- Debug logs for macro export, scene-profile application, overlay validation, overlay save, and effects save now include more actionable context for support.
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.5`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.5`

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Configuration cards, form rows, and action buttons now stack vertically instead of compressing text and controls into side-by-side layouts that remained hard to read even with scroll.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.4`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.4`

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Configuration windows now open at larger default sizes and can be resized instead of forcing all long localized labels into a cramped scrolling layout.
- Narrower window widths now collapse form rows and action cards more cleanly, improving Spanish and Galician text flow.

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.3`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.3`

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.2`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.2`

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Release metadata updated for stable distribution:
  - module version: `1.5.1`
  - download URL points to tag archive `v1.5.1`

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Explicit `layoutMode` contract (`absolute` vs `relative`) for camera geometry in module-owned scenes.
- Scene-wide relative layout validation with user-facing errors and warnings for missing targets, self-targets, cycles, offline targets, and non-visible targets.
- Reusable scene macros that apply the exported profile to whichever scene is active when the macro is executed.
- Dedicated unit coverage for window instance scoping and relative-layout validation rules.

### Changed
- Relative camera chains now resolve at scene level before render, allowing stable `A -> B -> C` dependency resolution.
- Scene camera profiles can be reused across scenes without being tied to the source scene id.
- All dedicated config windows now use per-instance scoped DOM ids, avoiding cross-window interference when multiple editors are open.
- Release metadata restored to stable production identity in manifest:
  - module id: `charlemos-camera-layout`
  - manifest URL on `main`
  - download URL on tag archive `v1.5.0`

### Fixed
- Restored scene macro export from the config hub after the scene-control refactor.
- Prevented docked cameras from keeping module-owned geometry while inside the Foundry dock.
- Removed orphaned preset/snap/resize flows and stale i18n keys left over from earlier layout tooling.

### Quality
- Simplified config/runtime code by removing dead preset tooling and stale release-branch identifiers.
- Validated release branch with `npm test` and JSON parsing for all locale files.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Scene-level camera control mode with explicit `native` vs `module` ownership for camera geometry.
- Dedicated layout geometry controls for module-owned scenes, including persisted `position`, `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height`.
- Relative camera positioning with edge/center alignment options (`above`, `below`, `left`, `right` variants).
- Scene layout generator with dynamic grid sizing, narrative presets, responsive/fixed units, and selectable user order.
- Offline-user editing support so camera layouts can be prepared before a player reconnects.

### Changed
- Native mode now preserves Foundry camera movement and resize behavior without module interference.
- Module mode now blocks native drag/resize affordances and reapplies geometry immediately when scene control mode changes.
- Scene layout presets now size cells from live video feed dimensions when available, with safe fallback sizing when no feed exists.
- Release metadata restored to stable production identity in manifest:
  - module id: `charlemos-camera-layout`
  - manifest URL on `main`
  - download URL on tag archive `v1.4.0`

### Fixed
- Resize handle visibility now follows ownership rules correctly: hover-only in native mode, always hidden in module mode.
- Scene profile macros now apply immediately instead of only loading draft data into the editor.
- Locale JSON files restored to valid structure after phase-8 testing changes.

### Quality
- Added unit coverage for scene control mode, relative positioning, scene layout generation, and offline-user selection.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Dedicated configuration hub with separate windows for Layout, Effects, Overlay, and Name Style.
- Shared config helpers to keep per-player editing consistent across all dedicated windows.
- Player-reset action with confirmation to clear both global and current-scene camera overrides for the selected user.

- Main camera config window now focuses on player selection, section summaries, and entry points to dedicated editors.
- Name Style configuration now follows the same selected-player workflow as the other dedicated windows.
- Scene macro export is labeled explicitly as a scene-level action.
- Release metadata restored to stable production identity in manifest:
  - module id: `charlemos-camera-layout`
  - manifest URL on `main`
  - download URL on tag archive `v1.3.0`

### Fixed
- Removed misleading scene-wide reset action from the player-focused config hub.
- Prevented branch-testing module identifiers from leaking into the stable release build.

### Quality
- Updated localization strings (`en`, `es`, `gl`) for the new config hub workflow.
- Added unit coverage for removing a single player layout without affecting other players.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- New overlay frame fitting controls in camera config:
  - **Overlay Fit Mode**: `auto`, `cover`, `contain`, `fill`
  - **Overlay Anchor**: center, edges and corners
- Updated localization strings (`en`, `es`, `gl`) for the new overlay controls.
- New and expanded unit tests for overlay fit/anchor normalization and renderer behavior.

### Changed
- Overlay rendering now applies explicit `background-size` and `background-position` from configuration.
- Legacy frame fallback behavior is preserved in `auto` mode for backward compatibility.
- Release metadata restored to stable production identity in manifest:
  - module `id`: `charlemos-camera-layout`
  - manifest URL on `main`
  - download URL on tag archive `v1.2.0`

### Fixed

  - font style (`normal`, `italic`)
- Dynamic font-family options sourced from Foundry server-available fonts, with fallback behavior.
- New rendering logic for nameplate placement and style normalization in the live camera renderer.
- Unit tests covering new name style normalization and config model behavior.

### Changed
